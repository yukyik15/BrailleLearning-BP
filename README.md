# BrailleLearning-BP

### How it works!
BrailleLearning is a learning platform meant to teach blind children to spell. Using a random generator in the website, a word will be read out from a list, and the children will need to write the word in braille using the buttons on the arduino. If the child is right, the buzzer will sound and a new word will appear, if not, then the website will read the word again.

### How we did it!
This project uses a multitude of different programming languages to connect the website to the arduino. So, there must be communication between them. The website is created using HTML/CSS, with a javascript backbone. The arduino was coded with C++. To allow communication between the two, a server written in Python was used.

### Significance
Braille is a type of written language for those who are blind or visually impaired. Through touching the raised dots in a specific pattern, they are able to understand letters of the English alphabet. In order to do this however, they need to learn the pattern of dots.
This is a necessary skill for children born with visual impairment or have become visually impaired as it would be important for them to understand text or information, in the form of braille, so they can receive an adequate education. 
Learning braille may not be accessible globally, so with an inexpensive tool such as BrailleLearning, it allows children who have not been able to practice or learn this alphabet to do so. It is important to not leave them behind the pursuit of education.
